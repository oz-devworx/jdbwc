<div class="head"><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</div>
<p>This document requires you have some knowledge of web-servers and the Java programming language (and ideally JDBC). Its beyond the scope of this document to explain these subjects in great detail.</p>
<p>Throughout this document there are some descriptive 
	terms that may be unclear. Their meanings 
	are clarified below.</p>
<p><strong>Client Side: </strong><br />
	the Java JDBC part of the JDBWC Driver. <br />
	Also referred to as <u>JDBC</u> (<em>Java DataBase Connector</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Server-Side: </strong><br />
	the PHP side (<em>with a web-server and one or more database-server/s</em>). <br />
	Also referred to as <u>WC</u> (<em>Web Connector</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Upstream: </strong><br />
	data going from the Client-side to the Server-side.</p>
<p><strong>Downstream: </strong><br />
	data going from the Server-side to the Client-side.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>JDBWC is an acronym for Java-Data-Base-Web-Connector. In essence, JDBWC is a Java JDBC Driver with its own server written in PHP. Ideally suited to Java Desktop applications that require JDBC access across wide area networks like the internet but do not wish to expose the remote database-server through the remote hosts firewall. EG: the database server does not need to be exposed to the internet at all.</p>
<div class="head"><a name="require" id="require"></a>Requirements</div>
<p><strong>Client-side:</strong> <br />
	Java JRE &gt;= 1.7.0 (<em>you can also compile from source to suit your target JRE</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Server-side: </strong><br />
	Apache-Web-server &gt;= 1.3.41<br />
	PHP &gt;= 5.1.x with MySQL &gt;= 5.x.x and/or PostgreSQL &gt;= 7.4.x</p>
<p>If your using MySQL you should enable the 
	PHP mysqli extension for full metadata functionality.<br />
	The existence of the mysqli extension is determined by the driver on the server-side if it is enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Supplied dependencies (licensed under an extended Apache-2 license)</strong><br />

<div class="head"><a name="install" id="install"></a>Installation</div>
<h2>Client-side (JDBC)</h2>
<ol>
	<li> Unpack the compressed download if you got it from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jdbwc/files/" target="_blank">releases area</a>. <br />
		The latest version should also be on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jdbwc/develop" target="_blank">SourceForge SVN server</a> (<em>as of 2010-04-18</em>).</li>
	<li> Copy the &quot;<code>jdbwc-lib</code>&quot; folder containing &quot;<code>jdbwc.jar</code>&quot; and dependencies 
		to a location relative to your Java application files. </li>
	<ul>
		<li>add &quot;jdbwc.jar&quot; to your applications classpath. If your app is an executable jar, you would usually include the file in your jar manifest's class-path using a relative path<br />
			EG: <code>Class-Path: jdbwc-lib/jdbwc.jar or Class-Path: jdbwc.jar</code> depending on where you put the jar files in relation to your java app.</li>
		<li><b>NOTE: </b>You will also need to add the other dependant files to your classpath. They are all contained in the lib folder (in the binary release and in the source release after building).<br />
		If you dont want to add the dependencies to your applications &quot;Class-Path&quot;: Build the jar from source (using build.xml with ANT) and change <code>index=&quot;true&quot;</code> to <code>false</code> on line 128 of build.xml to have the jdbwc.jar add them to its own Class-Path (then you only need to include <code>jdbwc.jar</code> in your applications Class-Path). Although the Class-Path entries are present in the jars manifest for all build types, due to having <code>index</code> set to <code>true</code> they are ignored. Its a poorly documented (or was at the time of writing this doc) byproduct of having indexes enabled on jar manifest files. The upside of indexes are (apparently) slightly better performance. Its recommended to have ANT or some other automated program write your manifest files intead of doing it manually due to the line length limitation of manifest files. Line length is limited by bytes, not characters and is difficult to work out manually for long Class-Path entries since manifests use utf-8 encoding.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If your app is not a packaged jar, you will need to organise updating the classpath via some other mechanism.</li>
	<li>If your using an IDE, add the jars to your build path as user libs (<em>system libs are ok too but not necessary</em>).</li>
</ol>
<h3> Notes: </h3>
<p> IDE's usually require all of the jars in the build path as do SQL Clients (like SQuirreL, SQLWorkBench, DBVisualizer, etc.).<br />
	For apps, the required jdbwc dependencies will be added to your classpath by jdbwc.jar</p>
<hr />
<h2>Server-side (WC)</h2>
<h3> Notes:</h3>
<p> Once the Server-side portion is installed and configs are set you can forget about it. 
	It only interacts with the JDBC portion and doesn't need to be maintained. <br />
	It does maintain an event.log file that you may want to 
	look at occasionally to see what's been happening on your server.<br />
	The event.log can be invaluable for debugging, however most exceptions or errors encountered on 
	the server will be thrown back to the JDBC driver as an SQL exception (or extension of).<br />
	Most PHP warnings will only be logged, not relayed as they usually aren't critical and don't warrant halting the driver.<br />
	SQL errors will contain the database servers original message with the offending SQL 
	query below that. The usual java exception trail will follow. 
	It will also be logged in the servers event log as an SQL-ERROR.</p>
<h4>Back to the installation:</h4>
<p> In the distribution package you will find a zip file called <code>server-side-bundle.zip</code>.<br />
	It contains some optional testing files which are explained in the README inside the zip.<br />
</p>
<h5>To setup the server-side part of this driver.</h5>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The folder: &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/config/local</code>&quot; is for testing servers. Its supplied for convenience when developing. If it is present on your server, its configs will be used in preference to the production ones in: <code>jdbwc/includes/config</code>.<br />
<span style="color:red;">The &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/config/local</code>&quot;  folder should _<u>NOT</u>_ be uploaded to production machines.</span></p>
<p><b>NEW:</b> The path settings have been simplified in this release for default folder locations of the &quot;<code>sessions</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>wc_logs</code>&quot; through the use of PHP's <code>realpath()</code> function. If you choose to use custom locations for these folders you will still need to edit these two paths.<br />
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Upload the contents of the upload folder to your webserver.
		<ul>
			<li> The <code>upload/jdbwc</code> folder can be uploaded to the public root dir or any subfolder.</li>
			<li> EG: <code>http://yourserver.ext/<strong>jdbwc</strong></code>, <code>http://yourserver.ext/subfolder/anotherfolder/<strong>jdbwc</strong></code>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a name="configure" id="configure"></a>Edit the file: &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/config/<u><strong>configure.php</strong></u></code>&quot; </li>
	<ul>
		<li> Put in a username and password (create new ones).</li>
		<li> Edit the paths and settings to suit your preferences and server.</li>
	</ul>
	<li> <a name="databases" id="databases"></a>Edit the file: &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/config/<u><strong>databases.php</strong></u></code>&quot; </li>
	<ul>
		<li> Put in the details for the databases you want access to.</li>
		<li> If there's more than one, follow the directions in the comment to add multiple databases.</li>
		<li> The database user must have full permissions (excluding grant perms).</li>
	</ul>
	<li> You will need to give the <em>.log</em> files in: &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/wc_logs</code>&quot; full write permissions.<br />
		You will also need to give the folder: &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/sessions</code>&quot; full write permissions and<br />
		the &quot;<code>jdbwc/includes/sessions/phpsess.db</code>&quot; (sqlite database) write permissions if you chose sqlite as the session handler (in the <code>configure.php</code> file).</li>
</ol>
<p>That's about it.<br />
	See the bundled <code>jdbwctest.zip</code> file in the distribution folder for details on how to setup your java class/s 
	to use the jdbwc.jar (JDBC driver). Look in the <code>connect()</code> method for some examples.</p>
<div class="head"><a name="use" id="use"></a>Basic Use</div>
<p>Also have a look at the test class in the file <code>jdbwctest.zip</code> (included in the distribution).</p>
<p>There are a number of optional connection parameters you can use to fine tune the connection.<br />
	The list of optional params may change between different releases depending on additional functionality supported by the driver.<br />
	See the section on <a href="#params">Connection URL in detail</a> for more info.</p>
<p>JDBWC is a JDBC Driver, so the standard JDBC syntax applies for general use.</p>
<p>To start a JDBC connection using JDBWC 
	you need to register the driver with the Java DriverManager 
	and then start a new JDBC connection using a JDBWC specific URL.<br />
	The url syntax and required parameters are demonstrated in the example.</p>
<p>Parameters (<em>everything after the ?</em>) can be in any order.<br />
	Registering the driver requires a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> handler, 
	starting a new Connection requires an <code>SQLException</code> handler.</p>
<p> See the example below.<br />
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> SSL is highly recommended over sending sql in plaintext. <b>A dedicated IP is required on the webserver</b> (localhost testing servers (EG: http://localhost/) are an exception to this rule.)<br />
	v1.0.0.3 will only work with validated certs.<br />
	v1.0.0.4 will work with validated and unvalidated/self-signed certs.<br />
	v1.0.1.1rc builds on the functionality of v1.0.0.4beta.<br />
	Un-validated/self-signed certs require the optional param: <code>nonVerifiedSSL = true</code></p>

<ul>
	<li>jdbc:jdbwc://</li>
	<li>jdbc:jdbwc:mysql//</li>
	<li>jdbc:jdbwc:postgresql//</li>
</ul>
<h5>What they do:</h5>
<p><code class="property">jdbc:jdbwc://</code><br />
	Requests a default connection from JDBWC. The default is MySql.</p>
<p><code class="property">jdbc:jdbwc:mysql//</code><br />
	Requests a MySql connection from JDBWC.</p>
<p><code class="property">jdbc:jdbwc:postgresql//</code><br />
	Requests a PostgreSql connection from JDBWC.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="reqprops" id="reqprops"></a>Required properties</h2>
<h5>Use all of:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>url</li>
	<li><s>port</s> (has been removed since v1.0.0.4. See: <a href="#url">url</a>)</li>
	<li> user</li>
	<li> password</li>
	<li> databaseName</li>
	<li>databaseUser</li>
	<li>databasePassword</li>
</ul>
<h5>What they do:</h5>
<p><code class="property"><a name="url" id="url"></a>url</code><br />
	The website URL containing the JDBWC server-side PHP bundle.<br />
	The url must start with a protocol (http or https) and have a trailing / <br />
	Examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>https://mydomain.ext:445/myfolder/myotherfolder/</code> (will use port 445)</li>
	<li><code>http://mydomain.ext:8080/myfolder/myotherfolder/</code> (will use port 8080)</li>
	<li><code>https://mydomain.ext/myfolder/myotherfolder/</code> (will default to port 443)</li>
	<li><code>http://mydomain.ext/myfolder/myotherfolder/</code> (will default to port 80)</li>
</ul>
<p> <em>The port number is only required for non standard ports in the range [1-0xfffe] (anything other than 80 or 443)</em>.<br />
	In rare circumstances custom port usage may incur up to 7ms  overhead per query (100 queries = +0.7 of a second). This rare delay seems to be related to the webserver, not the driver.</p>
<p> The JDBWC driver will append <code>jdbwc/index.php</code> to the end of the URL before requesting a connection from the server.<br />
	<em>If the domain name is unknown or not in DNS an IP can be used.<br />
	</em></p>
<p><code class="property">user</code><br />
	The user name you specified in the server-side <code><a href="#configure">configure.php</a></code> file.</p>
<p><code class="property">password</code><br />
	The password you specified in the server-side <code><a href="#configure">configure.php</a></code> file.</p>
<p><code class="property">databaseName</code><br />
	One of the database names you specified in the server-side <code><a href="#databases">databases.php</a></code> file.</p>
<p><code class="property">databaseUser</code><br />
	One of the database user-names you specified in the server-side <code><a href="#databases">databases.php</a></code> file.</p>
<p><code class="property">databasePassword</code><br />
	One of the database passwords you specified in the server-side <code><a href="#databases">databases.php</a></code> file.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Optional properties</h2>
<h5>Use or omit any of:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>proxyUrl</li>
	<li>timeout</li>
	<li> nonVerifiedSSL</li>
	<li> debug</li>
	<li> debugLogger</li>
	<li> debugLevel</li>
	<li> useDummyAgent</li>
</ul>
<h5>What they do:</h5>
<p><code class="property">proxyUrl</code><br />
	The proxy server URL to communicate through.<br />
	The url must start with a protocol (http or https). NO trailing / <br />
	Examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>http://myproxy.ext:8120</code></li>
	<li><code>http://myproxy.myserver.ext:8000</code></li>
</ul>
<p> <em>The port number is ALWAYS required for proxy servers</em>. If this parameter is used and there is no proxy, the connection will fail.</p>
<p><code class="property">timeout</code><br />
	Connection timeout. The maximum amount of time before a connection will timeout if it hasn't received a response from the server. If the server is offline, the driver will throw an exception as soon as it determines there's no one home.<br />
	OPTIONS: a time in milliseconds. 1 second = 1000 milliseconds</p>
<p><code class="property">nonVerifiedSSL</code><br />
	Allows the driver to use different qualities of SSL. By default its set to false and the driver will perform full SSL verification including strict hostname checking (similar to a web browser). If this option is set to true the driver will attempt to ignore the usual checks. If the driver is unable to ignore the SSL verification the driver will throw an exception from the <code>java.security</code> package or/and the <code>javax.net.ssl</code> package.<br />
	OPTIONS: true, false (or not used. defaults to false)</p>
<p><code class="property">debug</code><br />
	Turns debugging on or off. Its off by default. The other <code>debugXX</code> options will only take effect if this option is set to <code>true</code>.<br />
	OPTIONS: true, false (or not used. defaults to false)</p>
<p><code class="property">debugLogger</code><br />
	The type of logger to use for logging. Although there are 3 options, <u>only SimpleLog support is built in to this release</u>. <em><code>java.util.logging</code> and <code>Log4J</code> both require external property files.</em> To find out more about the logger see: <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.0.1/logging.html" target="_blank">http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.0.1/logging.html</a><br />
	OPTIONS: SimpleLog, <em>Jdk14Logger, Log4JLogger</em></p>
<p><code class="property">debugLevel</code><br />
	Debugging levels:<br />
	0 JDBWC informative/debugging, <br />
	1 JDBWC debugging,<br />
	2 JDBWC debugging and Enable header wire + context logging - Best for Debugging,<br />
	3 JDBWC debugging and Enable full wire + context logging,<br />
	4 JDBWC debugging and Enable context logging for connection management,<br />
	5 JDBWC debugging and Enable context logging for connection management / request execution.<br />
	OPTIONS: [0-5]</p>
<p><code class="property">useDummyAgent</code><br />
	This is rarely required. Its for situations where the host server blocks the default HttpClient <code>User-Agent</code>. The server would need to have been configured to deliberately block the HttpClient user agent.<br />
	OPTIONS: true, false (or not used. defaults to false)</p>
<div class="head"><a name="new" id="new"></a>What's new?</div>
<h5>Since v1.0.0.4beta</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Communication layer changed from being powered by Apache-HttpClient 4.0.1 to Apache-HttpClient 4.1.3.</li>
	<li>Changed httpClient connection-manager to threadsafe which fixed an error (java.lang.IllegalStateException: Connection pool shut down) from intermitently occurring when using the driver with a threaded application.</li>
	<li>Added support for new Java JRE 1.7.x java.sql methods to allow compiling with a jre7 runtime.</li>
	<li>Fixed a serverside bug that triggered a fatal error in the class <code>MySqli</code> on PHP 5.2.13
		(and possibly other versions below PHP 5.3.x).</li>
	<li>Simplified the (server-side) default folder paths for &quot;<code>sessions</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>wc_logs</code>&quot; through the use of PHP's <code>realpath()</code> function.</li>
	<li>Fixed a major bug that refused connections for domains using a <code>www.</code> subdomain. Now any subdomain is ok to use. I suspect this was a workaround remnant of the earliest versions of this driver that used the old (quite limited) communications backend.</li>
</ul>
<div class="head"><a name="limits" id="limits"></a>Limitations</div>
<ul>
	<li>JDBWC is aimed at JDBC 3/4 specifications with a few limitations (<em>also see the other limitations and <a href="#todo">TODO</a>'s</em>).</li>
	<li>No support for some of the newer JDBC 3 and 4 data-types.</li>
	<li>Data sizes of queries should be kept at a reasonable size. This applies to sending and receiving. Sending is limited to the $_POST limit set on the server (32MB is a common size for the post limit, but it could be much larger depending on your web servers configuration). Receiving is limited by the amount of free memory on the machine running the Driver (and the JRE running the driver). JDBWC caches the entire resultset/s from a query while it is open (this isnt so much of a problem as most modern machines have ample RAM and can fallback to pagefile. Falling back to pagefile would reduce performance. &lt; 10MB is a safe size).</li>
	<li>Connection Limits. In early versions &lt;= v1.0.0-3 multiple connections caused issues. Version v1.0.0-4 seems OK with multiple connections, but be carefull if latency or high error rates are an issue, as you could potentially  find things happening out of order. EG: a delete query sent after a select query, could end up getting to the server first, in which case your select query would probably not be correct based on the order it was sent. Much like un-synchonized Java code can in certain circumstances. For now, I would recommend using single connections when communicating across large unknown networks like the internet unless they are consistently reliable. This limitation is planned to be resolved in a future release by using a manual synchronization system for queries. See the <a href="#todo">TODO</a>'s for more information.</li>
	<li>Also see <a href="#issues">Known Issues</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="head"><a name="issues" id="issues"></a>Known issues</div>
<ul>
	<li>Shared IP's don't agree with the driver (or previous versions). Dedicated IP's, localhost testing servers or production servers on the same machine as the driver usually aren't a problem.</li>
	<li>* PostgreSQL ResultSetMetaData does not return key references. Unfortunately PostgreSQL is fairly awkward to extract ResultSetMetaData from. The current implementation does not correctly indentify table keys (primary, unique and multi). This is in part due to some limitations with PostgreSQL. Work is in progress to try and overcome this; however its not the main focus and a release time is not yet planned. DatabaseMetaData does NOT have this limitation.</li>
	<li>Not really an issue but worth mentioning. Server-Side testing in relation to Fatal Errors: Given the amount of different os/apache/php setups its not possible to test on all platforms. At least 3 variations (os/apache/php - version, build, configuration) are used during WC testing.<br />
		The only reason I can see for any Fatal-Errors with WC  would be if the web/php server didn't have a required PHP package installed. Care has been taken to avoid packages that are commonly not installed on many shared hosts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Its <u>strongly</u> advised to use an SSL connection when communicating across a network or the internet as you will be sending raw sql. To correctly install SSL your web-server <u>must have a dedicated IP</u>.</p>
<div class="head"><a name="todo" id="todo"></a>TODO</div>
<ul>
	<li>The main focus for the next release will be restructuring database specific code into brand specific packages. This is to make further database integration faster and easier. This has been started in the 1.0.0.5beta branch (<i>currently available from svn repository</i>) but didnt seem to work well with SQL clients for some unknown reason so this version extends on v1.0.0.4beta instead. Most of the improvements from v1.0.0.5beta were back ported to the v1.0.0.4beta version (<i>excluding the file restructuring</i>). A later version may be updated with the file restructuring changes if/when I have time and motivation to do so.</li>
	<li>Add a unique key to each statement for the purpose of processing results in the same order they were sent. If a required query has not responded, this will also give the driver the ability to detect it and resend the lost query if required. This is an important aspect for wide area networks and data relaying (particularly latent networks or/and those with high error rates). 
		It will also make the prospect of threading queries more feasable,  which would in turn provide a good controlled base for limiting the amount of active statements, gracefully timing out from the client side, cancelling and closing  statements. This single TODO will most likely be the entire focus of a new version/code-branch when it gets implemented.</li>
	<li>Add more database support (EG: any database that can be easily accessed from PHP).</li>
	<li>Finish PreparedStatement (<em>almost done</em>), 
		CallableStatement, ParameterMetaData (<em>almost done</em>) and anything else not implemented yet.</li>
	<li>Implement support for more of the newer JDBC 3 and 4 data types.</li>
	<li>JUnit tests (<em>not the highest priority at this point but would be good later</em>).</li>
</ul>
<div class="head"><a name="bugs" id="bugs"></a>Reporting Bugs</div>
<p>If you notice any, please report them in the 
	projects bug-tracking area at: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=233279&amp;atid=1089227" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=233279&amp;atid=1089227</a></p>
<p><u>Please</u> be specific with bug reports so they can be properly attended to. Vague reports will not be attended to unless the error is quite obvious.<br />
	Include some code or a description of the conditions you encountered the bug in so it can be reproduced. The more detail, the higher the chance of it being fixed quickly.<br />
