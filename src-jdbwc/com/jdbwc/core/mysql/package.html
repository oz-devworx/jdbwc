MySQL database specific implementations and helper classes.
<br />
Classes from this package should adhere to the file naming and structure conventions for jdbwc database packages as they are usually accessed using reflection.
<br />
<br />
A complete database package's classes must have the following names and implement the following infaces.
<br />
NOTE: The package classes are only accessed by the Driver via thier constructors and the interfaces they implement. There is no restriction on how they are implemented.<br />

<ul>
<li>DBConnectionImp MUST IMPLEMENT com.jdbwc.core.DBConnection</li>
<li>SQLMetaGetaImp MUST IMPLEMENT com.jdbwc.util.SQLMetaGeta</li>
<li>SQLResProcessorImp MUST IMPLEMENT com.jdbwc.util.SQLResProcessor</li>
<li>SQLTypesImp MUST IMPLEMENT com.jdbwc.util.SQLTypes</li>
<li>WCDatabaseMetaData MUST IMPLEMENT java.sql.DatabaseMetaData</li>
</ul>

Traditionally, JDBWC has its DatabaseMetaData split into 2 classes. 
One for largely static data, the other for data required from the database. 
This was done purely to make development easier and keep simmillar logic neatly grouped.
<br />
Any additional support classes needed to implement these interfaces should be located in the packages folder.
