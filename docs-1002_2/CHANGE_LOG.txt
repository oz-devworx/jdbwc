	3) Improvements

==============================================
1) Major Changes:

a)	none this time round.
    See also: 3-Improvements

==============================================
2) Bug Fixes:

a)	Fixed time based ResultSet methods:
      * getDate(...)
      * getTime(...)
      * getTimestamp(...)
	
    sql.NULL values now return java.null 
    as do empty time based values.
	

b)	Updated ResultSet getBoolean(...) methods to accept:
      * TRUE or FALSE, 
      * YES or NO, 
      * ON or OFF
      * 1 or 0
      
    This allows for variances in the way booleans are commonly
    stored across database platforms. This falls outside
    of the rules for MySql and Postgres but in the big picture
    should make shifting boolean data between unknown databases 
    less likely to break.
	
	
c)	Fixed minor type safety warnings in 
    com.jdbwc.exceptions.SQLError.java
    (This class performs some of the drivers exception handling tasks
    in a simmillar fashion to MySql Connector-J by MySql/Sun).


d)  Fixed Connection.isClosed() not working.

e)  Creating a new Connection by passing the 
    Driver a Properties file now works as expected.
    
    Connection Propetrty keys:
    ==========================
    * url               (website url EG: https://somedomain.com/admin/ 
                         [In this case, the "admin" folder 
                         at https://somedomain.com
                         should contain the 'web' folder "jdbwc"])
	* port              (server port number. https is usually 443 
	                     and plain-text is usually 80)
	* user              (apache username for 'web' folder "jdbwc")
	* password          (apache password for 'web' folder "jdbwc")
	* databaseName      (Database name)
	* databaseUser      (Database username)
	* databasePassword  (Database password)

==============================================
3) Improvements:

a)  Binaries have been compiled with JDK 1.6.0_10-b33

b)  Made the Driver parameter keys more consistent 
    with conventional jdbc naming conventions.

c)  Minor Code Clean up in the Connection implementation.
